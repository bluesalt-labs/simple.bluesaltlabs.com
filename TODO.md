- [ ] create a demo UI component to add all the events and stuff to. (see /src/components/sequencer/sequencer-demo-ui.js)
- [ ] needs drag-and-drop functionality, but this can be added later.
  - I have notes on this already. where are they?
- [ ] add controls component
- [ ] utilize the MusicEnum using best practices. I don't know how to do this yet.
- [ ] The sequencer first needs to play the same note, then update it so each row can be a different not (from my object constant.)
- [ ] next, the sequencer should either load drum samples (or ideally) let you define your own sounds so I can make my own samples.
- [ ] create a demo page for purecss so I can figure out how the layout system works. it doesn't make sense to me yet.
